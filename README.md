# Wiki-Search
Wiki Search is a dynamic web application that lets users search for articles using a custom WikiSearch API provided by NxtWave. It displays relevant results based on user input, including the title, link, and description for each entry. The app uses modern JavaScript features and Bootstrap for a clean, responsive UI.
